# Proposal: Set App Identity

## Why
The current app branding ("Create Next App") is generic and fails to represent the **Progressory** project identity.

## What Changes
- Update the application metadata to reflect the unique project name "Progressory" and description.

## Capabilities

### Modified Capabilities
- **App Identity**: The application will present itself as "**Progressory**" in browser tabs and SEO metadata.

## Impact
- `app/layout.tsx`: Update `metadata` export.
